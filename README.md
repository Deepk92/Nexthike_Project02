Data Wrangling on sets of data


As a junior data scientist, i have been assigned a new task to perform data wrangling on a set of datasets. The datasets have many ambiguities. You must identify those and apply different data-wrangling techniques to get a dataset for further usage


There are 3 data sets on which i have done the data wrangling using the important python libraries - Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matlplotlib.

In the Task 1, I have done Data Acquisition and Data Wrangling on dataset 1 and dataset 2 

All methods have been applied for data wrangling and combined the data from dataset1 and dataset2

In the Task 2, I have done Data Acquisition and Wrangling on Dataset 3. 
Then Concatenated combine data with Dataset_3 and Worked on missing values and outliers and validated the correctness of the data, And Checked the skewness and correlation of the data.
